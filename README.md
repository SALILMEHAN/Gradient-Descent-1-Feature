# Gradient-Descent-1-Feature
Gradient Descent model trained using "data_gradientDescent_1feature.csv" file. And at the end Gradient Descent Model and Linear Regression Model compared at the end by plotting graph of both of them. And result comes out to be the gradient descent model is more accurate than the linear regression model as the cost function is minimum for gradient descent model.
